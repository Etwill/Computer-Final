  <h1 style="text-align:center"> The life and times of Ethan Williams </h1><hr>
 <br> I have a fascination with stories both fictional and real. This has influenced my reading and learning habits to this day. Politics has taken much of my thinking in life. I hold strong opinions and have a pension for debating with my peers and superiors alike. I am not good with computers really. My passion has always been history and will probably be the end goal of my career. However I am notoriously changeable, so this may change. I think at this moment if I were to state my dream job I would simply want to become a historical consultant in the entertainment industry. I feel my passion may be to criticize movies and TV on their historical accuracy, why not make a career out of it?
